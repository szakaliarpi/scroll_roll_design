        <h2>Product research</h2>

        <p class="mb-50">You do the right research to help you identify your product's competition,
            as well as to identify and understand your product's users.
            Then, your purpose is to build a “better” product than your competitors by understanding the
            problem better than they do.
            <br><br>
            Also, it is the process of finding out how the product or feature you're currently
            working on is progressing, whether there are any changes in your target audience's needs and
            whether you need to make any adjustments to the product.

        <h2>User interview</h2>

        <p class="mb-50">The user interview is the type of research organized during any development stage to
            better understand user wants and needs and consequently – create a better product.

        <h2>Persona</h2>

        <p class="mb-50">
            Personas are helpful design tools to apply as a focal point to the target audience while creating high-tech products.
            Personas are "a precise definition of our user and what he wishes to accomplish,
            they are not real people but rather hypothetical archetypes of actual users." - Alan Cooper
            <br><br>
            A persona's goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.
            Descriptions include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information,
            as well as the environment in which a persona operates. Personas are not end-products.
            They are constantly changing and can be modified depending on the current state of the product.

                    A UX/UI designer can help you design your product from initial idea straight to the testing stage.

                    It can also help you generate more leads and improve conversion rates.
